## Screenshot Metadata

Screenshots were captured via Figma MCP API and displayed inline during analysis. Original images are embedded in the analysis process but not saved as separate files (MCP API provides 7-day temporary URLs).

For implementation, refer to:

- **phase2-domain.md** - Full component specifications with dimensions, colors, and layouts
- **phase2-summary.md** - Quick reference guide

## Accessing Original Designs

To view the original Figma designs:

1. Open Figma file: `Vz80RydxWcYHVnn2iuyV0m`
2. Navigate to the specific node ID (e.g., 144-299 for ModelCard)
3. Use Figma MCP tools to regenerate screenshots if needed

## Notes

- Screenshots show components in their designed states from Figma
- Actual implementation colors should use CSS variables from the design system
- All dimensions and measurements are documented in phase2-domain.md
- Icons shown in screenshots should be exported as separate SVG files for implementation
